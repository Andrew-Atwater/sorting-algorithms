1. You will create a list of 1000 random positive integers sampled from the range [1,1000] and use each sorting
algorithm to sort the list. Once sorted, you will use the verification algorithm above to demonstrate that your
algorithms work. NOTE: This is just to show your sorting algorithms work. This isnâ€™t the benchmarking step,
so you can use a different list for each one.
2. You will do the following 100 times. Each time you will record the time (in nanoseconds) it takes for your
sorting algorithms to sort each list. Once done, you will print the min, max and average times for each list size.
3. You will generate three lists of random positive integers of size 100, 10,000 and 1,000,000. All lists will be
randomly sampled from a uniform distribution over the range [1,1000]. This means your lists can or will have
duplicate values. This is expected.
4. Sort each list using all three algorithms. In each iteration (from step 2), use the same lists for all three
algorithms. This means you will need to make nine total lists (3 of each size).
5. Record all nine sorting times and store them.
6. Once all 100 sorts have been accomplished, find the min, max and average times for each algorithm for each
list size. Print these in a nice table, like the one below. Except where you see time below, you should put your
times in nanoseconds.
